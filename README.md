# Manaual Text Data Preparations
The first step before fitting text to a machine learning is **cleaning** your data. Any text contains punctuations, upper cases, white spaces,some characters such as emojis. So, our  task is to prepare our text by splitting it words and deal with puncutation. We will use a text called *Alice Adventures in Wonderland*.
