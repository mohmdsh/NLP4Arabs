## A Tutorial of Text Data Preparation for Machine Learning modeling. 



**A major question. What does** *modeling* **in the title indicate?**

The basic definition of *modeling* is training the machine to do a certain type of task.

#### The main objectives of this tutorial:
> * Learn about types of data preparation before any modeling process: manual preparation, NLTK method.
> * Learn about two major libraries that provides text preparation and encoding prcoess. 
#### Main terms that will be  frequently utilize in this tutorial:
> * Tokenization.
> * Vectorization (feature extraction).

# Manaual Text Data Preparations
The first step before fitting text to a machine learning is **cleaning** your data. Any text contains punctuations, upper cases, white spaces,some characters such as emojis. So, our  task is to prepare our text by splitting it words and deal with puncutation. We will use a text called *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*. You can find it in the following link https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28885/28885.txt. <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
## Cleaning the header and table of contents in Alice's text

This text -- available by  Gutenberg online library, contains a header which is conmposed of Gutenberg project's  introduction, and a table of contents. You have manually to cleany the file by doing the following:
> * Save the file in your local machine in the same directory of the python file.
> * Read the file. 
> * Strip the header [10830:], this slicing operation means start the text from the index 10830 (where the header ends) through the rest of the file.
> * Lower all upper cases.
> * Split the file into strings, then join.
> * Return the variable


```python
alice_file_name = 'alice.txt'

def readAlice(file_name):
    #open the file 
    Alice = open(file_name,'r')
    # read Alice
    Alice = Alice.read()
    # strip the header from readAlice 
    Alice = Alice[10830:] 
    Alice = Alice.lower()
    Alice = ' '.join(Alice.splitlines()[:3000])
    return Alice
aliceText = readAlice(alice_file_name)
aliceText

```
To view the file after slicing the header, you can print **aliceText[:100]** as the following:
```python
>>>print(aliceText[:100])
"             alice's adventures in wonderland                            lewis carroll                 the millennium fulcrum edition 3.0                                 chapter i                     "
```

## Cleaning the text manually
You will read the term *tokenization* in any NLP turorials or textbooks. For simplicity, it means breaking down a whole text into words or a string of characters. Each string is called *token*. In this section, we will turn alice's text into tokens or separate words.

Alice's text contains punctuations (such as commas and qoutes), and also abbreviated items (such as she's in ...). You can use regular expression to extract these items. You can do it by either using regular expression or use a ready-python tool. Here, we will use a tool called **string.punctuation**, which has a list of punctuation, to remove the target punctuations. 
```markedown
a list of punctuations !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
```


```python
import re
import string
# split aliceText into words by white space
words = aliceText.split()
# prepare regex for character filtering
character_filtering = re.compile('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation)) # remove punctuation from each word
stripped_words = [character_filtering.sub('', w) for w in words]
```
To view the stripped words:

```python
>>>print(stripped_words[:100])
['alices', 'adventures', 'in', 'wonderland', 'lewis', 'carroll', 'the', 'millennium', 'fulcrum', 'edition', '30', 'chapter', 'i', 'down', 'the', 'rabbithole', 'alice', 'was', 'beginning', 'to', 'get', 'very', 'tired', 'of', 'sitting', 'by', 'her', 'sister', 'on', 'the', 'bank', 'and', 'of', 'having', 'nothing', 'to', 'do', 'once', 'or', 'twice', 'she', 'had', 'peeped', 'into', 'the', 'book', 'her', 'sister', 'was', 'reading', 'but', 'it', 'had', 'no', 'pictures', 'or', 'conversations', 'in', 'it', 'and', 'what', 'is', 'the', 'use', 'of', 'a', 'book', 'thought', 'alice', 'without', 'pictures', 'or', 'conversation', 'so', 'she', 'was', 'considering', 'in', 'her', 'own', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'she', 'could', 'for', 'the', 'hot', 'day', 'made', 'her', 'feel', 'very', 'sleepy', 'and', 'stupid', 'whether', 'the', 'pleasure']
```
# Prepare Text Data with scikit-learn

Before training your data, you need to enable the machine to identify each string. Since machines can only understand numerical characters, we need to encode each word into numbers either intergers or floating values. This encoding process is called *vectorization* or *feature extraction*. One of the common libraries that offer encoding tools is **scikit-learn**. <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>
